    <p>I am Shane D. Wilson, a Grammy award winning recording and mixing engineer who, after 27 years of hard work, has reached the end of his usefulness in the world of music making.

      I noticed that all of the kids who were leaving the music business were pivoting to code.
      
      I want to be a cool kid.
      
      Iâ€™m pursuing a new career in coding. One of the things I've always enjoyed about being a recording engineer is the daily task of troubleshooting. There's always a puzzle to be solved. It feels like coding will offer me that same challenge.
    
      I'm excited about the path ahead of me and am quite eager to learn all that I can.
