        <p>I am Shane D. Wilson, a Grammy award winning recording and mixing engineer who, after 27 years of hard work,
          has reached the end of his usefulness in the world of music making.</p>

        <p> I noticed that all of the cool kids who were leaving the music business were pivoting to code.</p>

        <p> I want to be a cool kid.</p>

        <p>Iâ€™m pursuing a new career in coding. One of the things I've always enjoyed about being a recording engineer
          is
          the daily task of troubleshooting. There's always a puzzle to be solved. It feels like coding will offer me
          that same challenge.</p>

        <p>I'm excited about the path ahead of me and am quite eager to learn all that I can.</p>
